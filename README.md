## Setup
Setup your environment: `cp .env.example .env` and then modify `.env` according
to your system.

Install the tools for managing the dev environment:
* nix
** direnv
** lorri

These tools work on Macs, Linux, and WSL. You can roll without these, but
you are on your own in that case.

## Building
`make install`
